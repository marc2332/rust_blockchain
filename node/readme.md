### TO-DO
- [x] Reward the block forgers
- [x] Propagate transactions
- [x] Remove transactions from the mempool that has been bundled on a propagated block
- [ ] Prioritize sending transactions to the next block forger
- [x] Improve the election algorithm
- [x] Use `enum` instead of `struct` to easily have different types of Transactions inside the blocks 
- [ ] Make the discovery server a library and make a different crate to launch it as cli, this way the discovery server could be launched right from the simulation example
- [ ] Variable fees
- [x] Transactions might be duplicated across different blocks if the network latency is too high, it should make sure the transactions  hasn't been already added to a block
- [ ] Scalable block size relative to the network performance

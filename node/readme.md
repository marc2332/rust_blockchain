### TO-DO
- [x] Reward the block forgers
- [x] Propagate transactions
- [x] Remove transactions from the mempool that has been bundled on a propagated block
- [ ] Prioritize sending transactions to the next block forger
- [x] Improve the election algorithm
- [x] Use `enum` instead of `struct` to easily have different types of Transactions inside the blocks 
- [x] Make the discovery server a library,this way the discovery server could be launched right from the simulation example
- [ ] Synchronization support
- [ ] Fees ?
- [x] Transactions might be duplicated across different blocks if the network latency is too high, it should make sure the transactions  hasn't been already added to a block
- [x] Scalable block size relative to the network performance
- [x] Always have just the X last blocks of the blockchain on memory to avoid infinite memory increase
- [ ] Implement a consensus algorithm to prevent bad nodes to ignore certain transactions
- [ ] Improve simulation by allowing external nodes to join (this would need to have synchronization support)
- [ ] Fix the never-ending memory usage increase
